# HW1: Basic Image Manipulation
* [HW1.1](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW1/HW1.1)

   * Part 1 of this homework is writing a program to generate the following images from lena.bmp.
      1. Up-side-down lena.bmp.
      2. Right-side-left lena.bmp.
      3. Diagonally mirrored lena.bmp.

* [HW1.2](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW1/HW1.2)

   * Part 2 of this homework is using any kind of software to do the following things.
      1. Rotate lena.bmp 45 degrees clockwise.
      2. Shrink lena.bmp in half.
      3. Binarize lena.bmp at 128 to get a binary image.
