# HW1: Basic Image Manipulation
* Part 1 of this homework is writing a program to generate the following images from lena.bmp.
   * Up-side-down lena.bmp.
   * Right-side-left lena.bmp.
   * Diagonally mirrored lena.bmp.
   * Code: [HW1.1](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW1/HW1.1)
   
* Part 2 of this homework is using any kind of software to do the following things:
   * Rotate lena.bmp 45 degrees clockwise.
   * Shrink lena.bmp in half.
   * Binarize lena.bmp at 128 to get a binary image.
   * Code: [HW1.2](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW1/HW1.2)
         
* [Report](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/blob/master/HW1/CV1_HW1_%E5%A7%9A%E5%98%89%E6%98%87_R06922002.pdf)

# HW2: Basic Image Manipulation
* Part 1 of this homework is to binarize lena.bmp with threshold 128 (0-127, 128-255).
   * Code: [HW2.1](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW2/HW2.1)
   
* Part 2 of this homework is to draw the histogram of lena.bmp.
   * Code: [HW2.2](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW2/HW2.2)
   
* Part 3 of this homework is to find connected components with following rules:
   * Draw bounding box of regions.
   * Draw cross at centroid of regions.
   * Omit regions that have a pixel count less than 500.
   * Code: [HW2.3](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW2/HW2.3)
   
* [Report](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/blob/master/HW2/CV1_HW2_%E5%A7%9A%E5%98%89%E6%98%87_R06922002.pdf)

# HW3: Histogram Equalization
* This homework is to do histogram equalization with following rules:
   * Adjust the brightness of lena.bmp to one-third.
   * Do histogram equalization on dark image.
   * Show the histogram of the final image.
   * Code: [HW3.1](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/tree/master/HW3/HW3.1)
   
* [Report](https://github.com/JasonYao81000/CV2017Fall/blob/master/HW3/CV1_HW3_%E5%A7%9A%E5%98%89%E6%98%87_R06922002.pdf)
